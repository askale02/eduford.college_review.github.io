                <h3>Intermediate</h3>
                <p>MBA (INNOVATION & ENTREPRENEURSHIP)

                    OVERVIEW
Rationale
Government has declared 2010-20 as 'India's Decade of Innovation' and the industry is increasingly expecting its employees to have an entrepreneurial mindset. In addition, there is also an increase in the number of management graduates eventually taking the entrepreneurial plunge. It is becoming increasingly clear that managers who can conceive and execute innovative projects that add to the organisations' top and bottom lines will only be put in the leadership pipeline.

Since there are no institutes in India providing an MBA programme combining innovation and entrepreneurship/intrapreneurship, there is a huge opportunity for Symbiosis to fill this space. Moreover, the Diploma in Innovation Corporate Entrepreneurship (DICE) which Eduford Pune has been successfully running is a case in point to suggest that there would be takers for this programme both from the student side as well as from the industry side.

To sum up, sufficient demand exists for such an MBA programme and SIBM is also ready with a suitable programme based on its two-year experience of running DICE.
